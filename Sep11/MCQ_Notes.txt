1) Prepare for Sb HTTP Verbs GET/POST/PUT/DELETE

Entity
Repo
Service
Controller

Optional (Exception)

2) SB with JPA

3) Prepare for JWT Authentication 

   Json Web Token is an authentication key code to be generated for 
particular user based on their roles

As in our service, we have some urls any one can access but some urls
only particular domain user can access then once they send 
request to service, then we need to generate one authentication code 
which will be alive for particular period of time, then next time
no need to enter credentials, as access the resource and in Authorization
Header Context please pass the bearer token then the resource will be accessable

Now a days in market this kind of authentication is going on. 

What is Spring Boot Restful Servies : 
____________________________________

1) Rest stands for 

	-> Representational state transfer

Why Rest is in market now a days

previously people are using SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Based services, they are processing on 
xml format, but we need to render data in XML, JSON, STRING, Object etc....formats
then we need the help of Restful web services

2) Which proptocol we are using for REST

http

3) Which status code comes if the page not found

404

4) Which status code comes if internal server error

500

5) Which HTTP Code 200 indicates

Success

6) Which HTTP Method we use to make an HTTP request to create new resource

POST

Post submits an entityto the specified resource, often causing in state or 
side effects

7) Which HTTP Ver Used to update the existing resource

PUT

8) What is the difference between RequestMapping and GetMapping

RequestMapping only used to give alias mapping name for classes, 

where GetMapping used to given alias path for methods. 

9) See the below code and tell me how to access the resource

@RestController
@RequestMapping(value="api/exam")
public class HelloController
{
      @GetMapping(value="/welcome")
      public String welcome() {
	 return "Welcome to REST";
     }

     @GetMapping(value="/showEmploy")
     public List<Employ> showEmploy() {
	return repo.findAll();
     }

     @GetMapping(value="/searchEmploy/{id})
     public Employ searchEmploy(@PathVariable int id)
     {
	return repo.findById(id).get();
     }
}

How to Access welcome assume it runs in 8080 port 

locahost:8080/api/exam/welcome
localhost:8080/api/exam/searchEmploy/1

12) What is the status code for Forbidden

403

13) Which class responsible for performing Multitude of operations on Rest Services

1) RestTemplate

14) What is purpose of Spring Boot

To create Standalone, Production-grade spring based apps

15) What is the purpose of @SpringBootApplication

It is the convenience annotation that add @SpringBootConfiguration, 
@EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan

16) Default port for spring boot 8080

17)  Which Embeded Server will be there with Spring Boot By Default

Tomcat

18) What is purpose of @AutoWired

Automatically wires beans into properies, constructors or methods

19) What is the purpose of @Entity

To Declare any JPA entity

20) Which dependency to be added to spring for security

spring-boot-starter-security

21) What is the purpose of @Serive Annotation

To mark that class as service provider will give all built in and customized code

22) Can SpringBoot Can access Database if so, how can it access the database

Through automatic configuration of DataSource and JdbcTemplate

23) What is the role of @RequestBody annotation in Spring Boot

To Bind a method parameter to a web request body

24) How can you secure restful endpoint in spring 

Through spring security and configuration

25) @CrossOrign annotation in spring boot

To allow external application to access our service then we need to enable his

26) In Spring Boot How to give config information

specify in application.properties

27) What is the purpose of @PathVariable

To bind a method parameter to a path variable in URL

28) In SB how the way the @Bean to be defined

By using @Bean annotation in config class

29) How to define JPA repository in SB

By defining an interface that extends JPARepository

and add annotation above as @Repository

JPARepository generates default methods (CRUD) for the entity class specified
as no need to write code

30) What is the purpose of @GeneratedValue annotation
