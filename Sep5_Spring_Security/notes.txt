Spring Security is a framework which provides various security features like, authentication, authorization to create secure java enterprise applications. 

Spring Security Freamework targets two major areas of application as 

1) Authentication : It is a process in which any resource can be accessable after providing proper user name and password. 

2) Authorization : Once authentication happened, the authenticated user has permission to access which resources 


Spring Security framework supports wide range of authentication modes, as 

Basic Authentication
Digest Authenication

Form-based authenation
OAuth based authentication
Database-based authentication
JWT authentication


Spring-security core

Spring-security web

<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
		</dependency>

	<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-security-test</artifactId>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>

Then create a class name as SecurityConfig and to enable security, then 

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity

Then it asks to implement mandatory method, as configure() there please specify which urls you need to access freely, or which urls you need to give permission all to be specified here

protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .authorizeRequests()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
                .formLogin()
                .and()
                .httpBasic();
    }

To specify default user name and password, in properties files 

spring.security.user.name=user
spring.security.user.password=user

This is the way we need to specify credentials and then we can access that resource.
